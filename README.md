# Crowd_Analysis-with-CNN

## Detect and count the number of people in a densly crowded place

The dataset we ended up using was the “Shanghai Tech” dataset (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/shanghaitech), a dataset specifically created for crowd counting and density estimation. It contains 1198 annotated images of crowds of all different types. The annotations give us the coordinates of every person for each image.
